<p align="center">You can use the <strong>Live</strong> platform over at <a href="https://besochill.net">Be Social</a> and experience fully what we are developing.</p>

<p>The idea of 'liberty', is to live our lives in the way we feel as being right, without impeding on the 'liberty' of others. 'Liberty' is the same as 'Freedom of Speech', 
where we can voice our own thoughts and feelings, without being impeded by others, who's views are different. <strong>One mans terrorist, is another man's freedom fighter.</strong> Is a 
quote we should all learn to understand, and so we have to understand, not everyone in society agrees.</p>

<p>If a person wishes to preach 'hate', that is their choice to do so and why it is not right to attack another person's belief. We can however produce the ways and
means, so that not everyone sees the content they want to share. This is also why we are developing the platform, as a decentralised network with <strong>'Master Nodes'</strong> and each
<strong>'Master Node'</strong> is developed to work in conjunction, with the laws and regulations of that country and so offering a 'decentralised' User & Law governed platform.</p>
