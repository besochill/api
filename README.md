<p>The idea of 'liberty', is to live our lives in the way we feel as being right, without impeding on the 'liberty' of others. 'Liberty' is the same as 'Freedom of Speech', 
where we can voice our own thoughts and feelings, without being impeded by others, who's views are different. <strong>One mans terrorist, is another man's freedom fighter.</strong> Is a 
quote we should all learn to understand, and so we have to understand, not everyone in society agrees.</p>
